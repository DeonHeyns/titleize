# Titleize

Often I write emails, documents and blogposts and have no idea how to write the title. I mean when do I capitalize and when do I lowercase?

Dammit I don't know, I hated grammar and school and now it shows.

## Titelize to the rescue

Now all I do is copy my string into the text box and viola below it I see the correct titlecase. I share this with you and hope you enjoy.
